# Functions_and_OOPs

Welcome to the repository for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** assignment that blends foundational **Java + DSA** concepts with practical **Python** implementations. This project explores essential OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, decorators, and special methods in Python.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Functions and Generators

* Greeting functions and use of `*args` / `**kwargs`
* Differences between `print()` and `return`
* Custom generators for:

  * Squares
  * Palindromes
  * Even numbers
  * Powers of two
  * Prime numbers

### 🔹 Lambda Expressions

* Basic arithmetic and logic operations
* List processing (filter, map, reduce-style logic)
* String concatenation and comparison

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

* **Encapsulation**: Access modifiers, private attributes, getters/setters
* **Inheritance**: Single and multiple inheritance
* **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and duck typing
* **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces

### 🔹 Decorators

* Basic decorators
* Argument-based decorators
* Chained decorators
* Metadata preservation

### 🔹 Special Methods

* `__str__`, `__len__`, `__add__`, `__getitem__`, `__iter__`, `__next__`
* Property decorators: `@property`, `@setter`, `@deleter`

## 💡 Sample Classes Implemented

* `Animal`, `Dog`, `Mammal`, `GermanShepherd`
* `BankAccount`
* `Person`
* `Calculator`, `Employee`, `StringFormatter`, `Circle`, `TemperatureConverter`

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sahazad001/OOPs-assignment.git
   cd OOPs-assignment
   ```
2. Run Python files directly:

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

* Understand and implement key OOP principles in Python
* Learn how to write maintainable, modular, and reusable code
* Gain proficiency in using Pythonic features like decorators and generators
* Develop a deeper understanding of how DSA and OOP integrate in real-world programming
